## Overview

Grok2API is a Go gateway with a built-in React admin console. It manages independent Grok Build, Grok Web, and Grok Console account pools and exposes unified OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible APIs.

The Gateway routes requests through the Provider Registry. Account Sync refreshes credentials, quota, and models. Each Provider keeps independent account state and uses an isolated egress scope; usage, audits, and client billing are finalized after the request.

### Core capabilities

| Area | Capabilities |
| :-- | :-- |
| APIs | Responses, Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, Images, and asynchronous Videos |
| Clients | Codex, Claude Code, OpenAI-compatible SDKs, and Anthropic-compatible SDKs |
| Accounts | Bulk import/export, quota sync, credential renewal, conversion, tools, and cleanup |
| Routing | Model discovery, Provider pinning, sticky sessions, quota/concurrency guards, and bounded failover |
| Sessions | Stored responses, compact, prompt-cache affinity, and optional reasoning replay |
| Media | Image generation/editing, video jobs, local archiving, and URL/Base64/SSE output |
| Egress | HTTP/SOCKS/Resin, subscriptions, probes, proxy pools, allocation, fallback, and FlareSolverr |
| Operations | Dashboard, model routes, client keys, audits, runtime settings, and media libraries |

### Provider boundaries

| Provider | Authentication | Models | Main capabilities |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Grok Build | OAuth / Device OAuth | Discovered per account | Responses, Chat, Messages, compact, stored responses, paid-account video |
| Grok Web | SSO | Built-in, filtered by tier | Responses, Chat, Messages, stored responses, images, image editing, video |
| Grok Console | SSO | Built-in | Stateless Responses, Chat, Messages, images, image editing, video |

Each Provider keeps its own credentials, quota, health, cooldown, concurrency, and model capabilities. Failover stays within the selected Provider.

## Quick start

Official images support `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenyme/grok2api.git
cd grok2api
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

Generate secrets and place them in `config.yaml`:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
openssl rand -base64 32
```

```yaml
secrets:
  jwtSecret: "replace-with-the-generated-hex-value"
  credentialEncryptionKey: "replace-with-the-generated-base64-key"

bootstrapAdmin:
  username: "admin"
  password: "replace-with-a-strong-password"
```

Start the service:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f grok2api
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The image already includes the frontend; SQLite data and local media are stored in the Compose volume.

### Run from source

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
make run
```

For frontend development:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Set up the gateway

1. Sign in with the bootstrap administrator.
2. Connect a Build, Web, or Console account.
3. Wait for its quota and model capabilities to sync.
4. Review the public routes under **Model Routes**.
5. Create a client key under **Client Keys**.
6. Call a `/v1/*` endpoint with that key.

After first sign-in, change the administrator password and remove `bootstrapAdmin` from the configuration. Never rotate `credentialEncryptionKey` after credentials have been stored.

### Account operations

| Provider | Connect or import | Export |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Build | Device OAuth, JSON/JSONL | Re-importable account file |
| Web | Pasted/TXT SSO, JSON/JSONL | Re-importable account file |
| Console | Pasted/TXT SSO, JSON/JSONL | Re-importable account file |

Imports accept UTF-8 BOM. Bulk quota sync, Build credential renewal, Web→Build/Console conversion, account tools, and cleanup report live progress.

Web account tools can accept the terms, set a random birthday corresponding to an age of 20–40, and enable NSFW. Completed steps are recorded and skipped on later runs.

Automatic deletion of old `reauthRequired` accounts is available but disabled by default. Active inference leases and video jobs are protected.

> [!TIP]
> To migrate from the Python version, export Grok Web SSO tokens as TXT and import them under **Grok Web**. Old pool metadata and databases are not compatible.

## Models and routing

Build models are discovered from each account's actual capabilities. Web and Console use built-in catalogs. The **Model Routes** page shows Provider-qualified routes, endpoint capabilities, and supporting-account counts; clients should treat the currently serviceable results from `GET /v1/models` as authoritative.

### Grok Build

Build does not use one global static model list. Account synchronization reads the upstream `/models` endpoint, and different accounts, subscription tiers, or staged rollouts may expose different models. Routing retains these per-account capabilities instead of replacing the global catalog with one account's response.

| Model | Type | Availability | Gateway surfaces |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Conversation models returned by upstream `/models` (for example, `grok-4.5`) | Conversation | Returned by the selected account | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages, compact, stored responses |
| `grok-composer-2.5-fast` | Conversation | Grok Build OAuth accounts | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages; supplemented from the OAuth session contract when a sparse upstream catalog omits it |
| `grok-imagine-video-1.5` | Video | Super/paid Build accounts | Videos; not assigned to Free or unknown-entitlement accounts |

Conversation requests are translated to the Build Responses protocol while preserving the tool, reasoning, multi-turn, and prompt-cache compatibility required by Codex and Claude Code. Build currently exposes no image generation or image editing routes.

### Grok Web

Web uses a built-in catalog filtered by account tier; higher tiers inherit lower-tier models.

| Model | Type | Minimum tier | Gateway surfaces |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `grok-chat-fast` | Conversation | Basic | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages |
| `grok-chat-auto` | Conversation | Super | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages |
| `grok-chat-expert` | Conversation | Super | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages |
| `grok-chat-heavy` | Conversation | Heavy | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages |
| `grok-imagine-image-lite` | Image | Basic | Images Generations |
| `grok-imagine-image-quality-lite` | Image | Super | Images Generations |
| `grok-imagine-image-edit` | Image Edit | Super | Images Edits |
| `grok-imagine-video` | Video | Super | Videos |

### Grok Console

Console uses the catalog built into the current release. Conversation forwarding is stateless, while image and video models use the standard xAI resource APIs.

| Model | Type | Gateway surfaces |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning` | Conversation | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages |
| `grok-4.20-0309-reasoning` | Conversation | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages; the model reasons but the upstream rejects configurable `reasoningEffort` |
| `grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309` | Conversation | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages |
| `grok-4.5` | Conversation | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages |
| `grok-4.3` | Conversation | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages |
| `grok-build-0.1` | Conversation | Chat Completions, Responses, Messages |
| `grok-imagine-image` | Image, Image Edit | Images Generations, Images Edits |
| `grok-imagine-image-quality` | Image, Image Edit | Images Generations, Images Edits |
| `grok-imagine-video` | Video | Videos |

Generation and editing capabilities for the same Console image model are grouped into one logical model row; no separate `-edit` model copy is required.

Public names normally omit the Provider. Internally, routes use `Build/`, `Web/`, or `Console/`; qualified names can pin a request to one source.

Web can be weakly linked one-to-one with matching Build and Console accounts. Links share only an anonymous egress identity and provenance display. They never merge credentials, quota, health, cooldown, concurrency, capabilities, or billing.

### Codex, Claude Code, and prompt caching

Responses and Messages support streaming, tools, reasoning, multi-turn sessions, and compaction. Stable client session signals are preserved for Grok Build prompt-cache affinity. Cache hits still require a compatible upstream account and an unchanged prompt prefix.

Responses and Chat Completions report OpenAI-style total input. Messages reports Anthropic-style uncached input and cache reads separately. Audits retain total and cached input for billing reconciliation.

## API

Inference endpoints use a client key:

```http
Authorization: Bearer g2a_xxx_xxx
```

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `GET` | `/healthz`, `/readyz` | Liveness and readiness |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | Serviceable models |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses` | Responses JSON/SSE |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses/compact` | Compact a supported Response session |
| `GET`, `DELETE` | `/v1/responses/{id}` | Read or delete a stored response |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | Chat Completions JSON/SSE |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages JSON/SSE |
| `POST` | `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/images/edits` | Generate or edit images |
| `POST`, `GET` | `/v1/videos/*` | Create and inspect video jobs |
| `GET` | `/v1/media/images/{asset_id}`, `/v1/media/videos/{asset_id}` | Read archived media |

Stored responses and compact depend on the selected Provider. The signed-in admin console provides live examples at `/docs`; Swagger is available only when `server.swaggerEnabled: true`.

Client keys support model allowlists and optional RPM, concurrency, spend, and expiry limits.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer g2a_xxx_xxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "your-model",
    "input": "Explain quantum tunneling in three sentences.",
    "stream": true
  }'
```

## Egress and Cloudflare

Egress nodes are scoped to Build, Web, Console, or Web assets. The admin console supports:

- HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4/4A, SOCKS5/5H, and Resin
- Subscription and text/Base64 import
- Batch probes, filtering, deletion, assignment, and balancing
- Fallback per scope: none, direct, or a fixed node
- Proxy-pool mode without global cooldown after one connection failure
- Immediate recovery probes after fixed-proxy transport failures, with per-node coalescing and bounded waiting for fast retry
- Optional [Egress Quality Guard](./tools/egress-quality-guard/README.md) for active per-node model probes, guarded quarantine, and recovery; enable it with the built-in `quality-guard` Compose profile

To enable the guard, add a `qualityGuard` section to `config.yaml`, then start
the profile. The main service creates and reuses a non-exportable system probe
identity automatically:

```yaml
qualityGuard:
  enabled: true
  model: "grok-4.5"
```

```bash
docker compose --profile quality-guard up -d --build
```

Existing preview deployments that still contain `clientKeyID` can upgrade
directly. The field is accepted for compatibility but ignored and can be
removed; any manually created probe key is intentionally left untouched.

After changing this configuration, run `docker compose --profile quality-guard restart grok2api egress-quality-guard` to reload the base settings; policy edits made in the admin page still hot-reload.

The normal `docker compose up -d` command does not start the guard or generate
probe traffic. The sidecar receives a narrowly scoped internal credential from
the main service and never stores or uses the administrator password. See the
linked guide before enabling automatic quarantine.

Resin usernames can contain `{account}`:

```text
socks5h://Default.{account}:RESIN_PROXY_TOKEN@resin:2260
```

The placeholder becomes a stable anonymous identity. Linked Web, Build, and Console accounts can share it; raw tokens and email addresses are not used.

For managed Web/Console Cloudflare Clearance:

```bash
docker compose --profile flaresolverr up -d
```

Then select `FlareSolverr` under **Runtime Settings → Media & Network → Clearance** and use `http://flaresolverr:8191`.

The egress layer retries only connection failures known to occur before request submission. It does not replay submitted generation requests, authentication failures, exhausted quotas, or upstream rate limits.

When a fixed proxy enters cooldown after a transport failure, grok2api starts an independent connectivity probe immediately. Concurrent failures share one probe. A later request bound to that node waits for at most five seconds, reloads persisted node state after a healthy probe, and continues without waiting for the full cooldown. An unhealthy probe preserves the cooldown. Proxy-pool leases use fresh tunnels, so one rotating exit failure never cools the whole pool. See [Immediate egress failure probe and bounded retry](./backend/internal/infra/egress/FAILURE_RETRY.md) for the design and safety invariants.

## Configuration and deployment

`config.yaml` contains startup settings; Provider and operational settings are managed in the admin console and hot-reload unless marked otherwise.

| Deployment | Database | Runtime store | Media |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Single instance | SQLite | Memory | Local directory |
| Multiple instances | PostgreSQL | Redis | Shared read/write directory |

Multi-instance deployments require a unique `deployment.instanceID` per replica, one shared `clusterID`, and `sharedMedia: true` only after the media directory is shared correctly.

PostgreSQL credentials can be injected without storing them in `config.yaml`:

```bash
GROK2API_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:password@host:5432/grok2api?sslmode=require' docker compose up -d
```

A non-empty `GROK2API_DATABASE_URL` overrides `database.postgres.dsn` and automatically selects the `postgres` driver. An empty value is ignored. Supported URL schemes are `postgres://` and `postgresql://`; SQLAlchemy's `postgresql+asyncpg://` form is rejected with a migration hint. The application does not implicitly read the generic `DATABASE_URL`; platforms that provide it can map it explicitly with `GROK2API_DATABASE_URL: "${DATABASE_URL}"`. Database configuration precedence is built-in defaults, `config.yaml`, then `GROK2API_DATABASE_URL`. The current CLI has no database override.

Important optional settings:

- `audit.ledgerMode`: `observe` reports ledger faults; `enforce` can pause new inference to protect billing integrity.
- `routing.accountIsolatedConnections`: partitions outbound TCP/HTTP pools by account for external L4 or connection-hash load balancers. It is off by default because it increases connections, TLS handshakes, memory, and file-descriptor usage.
- `routing.segmentedSelectorEnabled`: optimizes large account pools while retaining full-planner fallback and atomic guards.
- Build response-header timeout and exact-match 403 invalidation rules are hot-reloadable.
- **Sync latest version** applies the validated Grok Build client version and User-Agent.

## Production checklist

- Use HTTPS and enable `auth.secureCookies`.
- Keep Swagger disabled on public deployments.
- Use strong, backed-up secrets; never commit credentials, cookies, exports, or databases.
- Back up `config.yaml`, the database, and media storage.
- Use PostgreSQL, Redis, and shared media for multiple instances.
- Put a reverse proxy and access controls in front of public deployments.

## Development

```bash
cd backend
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
go build ./cmd/grok2api
```

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
